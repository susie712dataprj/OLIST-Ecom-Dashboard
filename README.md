# OLIST Ecom Dashboard
# Introduction
Applying the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist found on Kaggle, I built a dashboard monitoring all the commercial activities at Kaggle such as: order trends, customer behavior, and sales performance. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers
# Overview
I use 2 software:
Google Sheets: This is just for connecting data through Power Query.
* We used a translation function to translate the customerâ€™s review.
* Add brazil_states table to get more external data.
* Add some sub tables like RFM_segments in PBI.

Power BI: Main working file, all the data cleaning process to visualization is done in Power BI.
